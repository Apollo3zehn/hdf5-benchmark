# hdf5-benchmark

This repository contains a number of benchmarks to compare the performance of different independent HDF5 implementations to the original HDF5 C-library.

Everytime there is a commit on the master branch of this repository, the benchmarks will be executed in the GitHub Actions CI pipeline and the graphs will be updated with the new results.

Please create a PR if you wish to add more benchmarks or improve existing ones.

You can watch the graphs here: https://apollo3zehn.github.io/hdf5-benchmark/
